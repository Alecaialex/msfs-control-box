# msfs-control-box
This project involves designing a 3D-printed control box using a Raspberry Pi, a display, and rotary encoders to create physical flight controls for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The box will control key functions like altitude, airspeed, and the MCDU of the airplane.
The project can be highly improved by using more physical parts such as MCDU buttons or LCD screens for altitude/speed (Maybe will do it when I can buy them)
